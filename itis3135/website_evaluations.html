        <h3>Website 1: <a href="https://www.teamcharlottemotorsports.com">Team Charlotte Motorsports</a> (BAD)</h3>
        <p>
            This website is a local motorcycle / atv / water sports dealership. They provide services from parts sales,
            full repairs, insurance clams repairs, and after market upgrades. They have a well-rounded staff that can

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>C</strong>ontrast: Poor contrast on nav bar between the red and white. This makes the text hard
                to read.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>R</strong>epetition: Once you get into the inventory of the shop. The repetition between the
                photos is poor because some bikes are using a stock image instead of actual pictures.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>A</strong>lignment: In the navigation between pages on the inventory sections, the alignment for
                the text is to close together making it looked smashed together.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>P</strong>roximity: The proximity of the filter buttons is un even and mix-matched. This makes it
                have too much blank space.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <section>
        <h3>Website 2: <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a> (GOOD)</h3>
        <p>Amazon and subsidiaries like Shopbop, and Zappos support shopping for a wide range of products without the
            need to travel to a physical store. And Prime shipping offers fast delivery options.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>C</strong>ontrast: The contrast for Amazon is very effective. The navigation bar is easy to read,
                and you can the more important advertising.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>R</strong>epetition: Amazon Uses repeating boxes to have each section in its own field. This
                continues for when you see the items you are searching for.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>A</strong>lignment: Everything in the body is center aligned for easy viewing across all different
                styles of view devices.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>P</strong>roximity: Everything is evenly spaced through-out the pages giving it the look of perfect
                proximity
