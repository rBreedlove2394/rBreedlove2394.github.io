    <h2>Contract</h2>

    <p id="contract">I, Ryan B. Breedlove agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my
        Fall 2024, ITIS3135, Web App Design and Development
        with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen. I understand that all work that
        I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
        and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork,
        or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance,
        not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it's possible to find many examples
        online or even view my classmate's code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn,
        and will not cut-and-paste code except where I have properly given credit
        (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates. </p>
        <p>Signed: Ryan B. Breedlove , 15/09/2024</p>
